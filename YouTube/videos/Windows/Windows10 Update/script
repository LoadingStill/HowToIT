Intro: Image 2-4 seconds
0:06
welcome to how to it tutorials my name
0:08
is ryan young today we'll be learning
0:10
how to update windows 10.
0:13
first thing you want to do is turn your
0:14
computer on and go ahead and log into
0:16
your computer
0:18
next we're going to go down here to the
0:19
start button at the bottom left and
0:21
we're going to click the gear icon that
0:23
says settings
0:25
we're going to go up here to windows
0:27
update and security go ahead and click
0:29
there
0:31
and we're gonna click check for updates
0:34
sometimes you will get updates sometimes
0:36
you will not
0:37
it just depends on the day not every day
0:40
microsoft pushes out an update
0:42
look at this i have a lot of updates to
0:44
do
0:46
so as these updates take place let's go
0:48
ahead and go through some of the
0:49
settings the first one you're going to
0:51
see is pause updates for seven days what
0:53
this will do is allow you to pause
0:55
updates you can typically pause for up
0:57
to a month and a half two months
0:59
the reason you would want to do this is
1:00
if you have software that you are
1:02
running that you do that will break on
1:04
an update
1:06
you
1:06
do not want windows to update if it's
1:08
going to ruin that software this is more
1:11
towards corporate and less towards
1:13
standard users
1:14
change activity hours what these will do
1:17
is let's say i use my computers from 8
1:19
am to 5 pm windows will not restart or
1:21
update during that time which is very
1:23
convenient
1:25
view update history this will tell you
1:27
what has successfully installed so you
1:29
can look here and see where it says
1:30
kb5013887
1:34
and you can say oh this has installed i
1:37
am good and you can see that in here as
1:39
well
1:40
advanced options let's go ahead and
1:42
click this here
1:43
advanced options will allow you to
1:45
receive updates from other microsoft
1:47
products
1:48
along those products will be microsoft
1:50
word
1:51
excel powerpoint
1:53
download updates over a meter connection
1:55
is things like a hotspot typically a
1:58
meter connection will be you are charged
2:00
per gig
2:01
and your home wi-fi may not be a meter
2:03
connection or it may be depending where
2:05
you live in the world restart device as
2:07
soon as possible
2:08
this is really useful if you do not
2:10
consistently update yourself
2:12
leave this on if you just want to go
2:14
ahead and do its thing
2:16
so notifications when your pc requires a
2:18
restart to finish typically you do not
2:20
want this on if you have this on
2:23
or if you have restart as soon as
2:25
possible off
2:27
keep the notifications on that way you
2:28
know to restart your own computer
2:30
and you can also say pause your updates
2:33
right here as well until this date and
2:35
like i said before you can typically do
2:38
the seven day button which will push you
2:39
out and you can click the seven day
2:40
button again and the last day currently
2:42
i can do this is monday august 1st
2:45
and it is the
2:46
27th of june so that gives you kind of a
2:49
sense of how far out you can push this
2:52
let's go back and see if the updates
2:53
have finished
2:58
i'll come back when the updates are
2:59
finished this way you can see what's
3:00
going on
3:02
okay we are back and as you see updates
3:04
have completed i'm going to go ahead and
3:06
click restart now
3:09
and all this is going to do is restart
3:10
the computer
3:12
and update it
3:35
as you see the restart has completed and
3:37
you have updated windows 10.
3:40
enjoy your day
3:46
you
